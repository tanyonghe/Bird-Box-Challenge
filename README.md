# Bird Box Challenge  

![Workshop Prototype](docs/images/home.png)  
Help Truck-kun avoid Bird Boxes on the road!  
And just like in the movie Bird Box, sometimes you can't see them coming... literally!  

## Project Overview
Bird Box Challenge is a game that introduces gamification to typical physiotherapy, making it fun for patients.  
This is made possible by attaching a tracking hardware (for orientation and accelerations) to affected limbs.
However for this project, a mobile phone using the Sensor UDP app was used in place of an accelerometer.  

Different difficulties and extensions of the game can be further added to cater to the needs of physiotherapy patients with varying conditions and severities.  
This small project aims to become a Proof of Concept for future gamification ideas such as this! (:
